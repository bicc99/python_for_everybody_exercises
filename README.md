# python_for_everybody_exercises

This was online self-lerning on Python languages.

Course: Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python) by University of Michigan. Coursera.org

Note:
if someone wanted to use the codes as an sample to complete their exercises,
I higly reccommended to use a proper text editor (e.g. Visual Studio Code, Atom, etc.) to run the codes.
It is more effective than a built-in text editor provided on the course.
