# python_for_everybody_exercises

This was online self-learning on Python language.

Course: Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python) by University of Michigan. Coursera.org

Many thanks to Dr Charles Severance for offering the free course.

Note:
if someone wanted to use the codes as a sample to complete their exercises,
I highly recommended using a proper text editor (e.g. Visual Studio Code, Atom, etc.) to run the codes.
It is more effective than a built-in text editor provided on the course.
